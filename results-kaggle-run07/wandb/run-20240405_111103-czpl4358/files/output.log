/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/checkpoint_connector.py:145: `.test(ckpt_path=None)` was called without a model. The best model of the previous `fit` call will be used. You can pass `.test(ckpt_path='best')` to use the best model or `.test(ckpt_path='last')` to use the last model. If you pass a value, this warning will be silenced.
